# Echo Util
This project does 3 simple things to Echo360:
## Week/Day Specification
Instead of just showing the date of a lecture, it will also show which week the lecture is from, as well as the day of the week.  
i.e "Week 2 Monday, July 29, 2024"
## Grouping
A line will be added between any two lectures from different weeks.  
## Descriptive Download Names
When clicking on a lecture to download, instead of clicking "Download Original", you may click "Echo Util Download".  
This will start a download in the background (indicated by the text "Downloading..." below the search bar).  
When complete, the downloaded file will have a name in the format of "COURSE_Week_n_Weekday.mp4".
## Installation
Paste the code into a JS injection browser extension like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).  
Feel free to contact me if you need further explanation, at the time of writing this I need to catch up on some lectures...
